# Lantern DAO

## Overview

Lantern DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) designed to integrate secure yield farming, DeFi auction platforms, and NFT financialization (NFT-Fi). It aims to create a unified ecosystem where users can participate in governance, yield generation, NFT valuation, and financial activities in a transparent and decentralized manner.

## Key Features

### 1. Yield Farming Protocol

- **Objective**: Provide curated strategies to maximize revenue generation for DAO participants.
- **Mechanics**:
  - Users can stake their tokens in curated pools.
  - Yield is generated through optimized DeFi strategies governed by the DAO.
  - A portion of the yield is directed to the DAO treasury.

### 2. DeFi Auction Platform

- **Objective**: Facilitate fair and transparent auctioning of digital assets, including NFTs and tokens.
- **Mechanics**:
  - Auction types include English, Dutch, and sealed-bid auctions.
  - Fees collected from auctions are shared between the DAO treasury and participating members.

### 3. NFT Financialization (NFT-Fi)

- **Objective**: Enable NFTs to become liquid and financially useful within the ecosystem.
- **Mechanics**:
  - NFTs minted in Lantern DAO automatically have an associated pool with DAO tokens.
  - The pool provides initial liquidity and valuation for the NFT.
  - Users can collateralize their NFTs for loans or trade them directly within the DAO ecosystem.
